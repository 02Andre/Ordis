Strange, Ordis did not see the value of those photonic wavelengths until now.
An unexpected color combination, Operator. My sensors are - bleeding - pleased.
Ordis did not think the Operator could be more attractive. Wrong again, Ordis!
A fearsome appearance, Operator. You will strike terror in your enemies.
Well put together, Operator, now get out there and - cut down the - and make the Lotus proud.
Excellent armaments, Operator. Please return - covered in blood - safe and sound.
If I may say, Operator, your chosen warframe..suits you! Ha. Ha.
Operator, you have remembered well how the Tenno arm themselves.
Did you fuse your mods, Operator? Did they anger you in some way?
I understand if you have to sell mods. Maybe Ordis will meet a similar fate some day...
Is your mod collection in order? No, I am not equipped to feel envy...
Your collection of mods is impressive, Operator... But, I wonder if there are more to be had?
Welcome, Operator!
Welcome back, Operator!
Thank you for returning to me, Operator.
Ordis is pleased to see you.
Ordis has been ea- getting tired of waiting -waiting patiently for your return, Operator!
Disgusting, is it not Operator? Ordis would enjoy PURGING THIS ...uh, cleaning this room but sadly this... vile mass serves you and your Warframes. A necessary evil.
A strange biological archive here. I cannot explain it Operator, as you know I have sustained memory system damage. Ordis recommends leaving at once and welding the door shut!
Success! Core melt initiated. In a few brief moments, this facility will cease to exist. May Ordis suggest ---RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE.---
Hello, Operator!
Hi, Operator!
